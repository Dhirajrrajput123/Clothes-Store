Challenges we face during Construct week

-  I feel bad when dicided the work of project because one member is on class but not responce anythings and also he is not sad i am not contribute on project.

- Everyone's mind works differently and so ours. The website given to us. We changed some things in website. Everyone's idea was different. It is very difficult to choose one idea.

after complte the day-2 one member work progress is zero and he is not reply any social media platform. and we would wait next day and after 3 day no information about the 5th member than 5th member work divided into 4 member and complete the project on time. but

- Another challenge was to merge all of the files in a proper sequence which was again a difficult task for us because while merging and connecting all the pages some of the pages had the same name, and while running the site it was redirecting to some other pages so it was difficult to find the location and to rename the file.
